======

This folder contains all formulae used in the paper to present the results.

Each folder is named after the number of available amount of hardware, which
we used 32,64,128,256 and 512.

Each formula inside each folder are named hw$HW-vm$LOADp.pbs , where HW is
amount of available hardware and LOAD is the percentage of resources
necessary to deploy all Virtual Machines in relation to the available
resources, for more info you may re-read the paper.

Note that all files are compressed with xz, you may need to uncompress
before using a solver.
